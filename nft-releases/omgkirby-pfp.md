## Artwork

The defining trait of the project is the mask each character wears. A common scene in anime and manga media, which Valerie has obsessively consumed since she was a kid, is a summer festival where characters wear traditional Japanese masks.&#x20;

Through the widespread distribution of Japanese culture, these masks have taken on playful and kawaii (Japanese for “cute”) associations. Influenced by the anime style of the omgkirby Genesis and the communal nature of lofi music, Valerie has reinterpreted these mass-produced masks in her own style. Each avatar wears Tokyo street style and oversized fashion. These are independent works of art, made unique with over 180 individually drawn attributes.



## The Genesis train has left the station...

The mask is your ticket on board to join our community. Your mask is a manifestation of the original spirit of omgkirby: anonymity, creativity and all around vibes. Look out for epic future collaborations with iconic musicians alongside our community members. Kirbies embrace the possibilities of generative NFT music and visual art. As our next stop for the DAO treasury, these avatars launch the future of omgkirby, and that future looks bright. Let's chill, masks & headphones on.
