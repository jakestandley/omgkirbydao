# Overview

The omgkirby DAO launched with a [genesis NFT drop](https://www.notables.co/gallery/omgkirby) of 3,000 unique pieces of generative lofi music. Each of these individual NFTs was a novel combination of algorithmically-assisted music and hand-drawn art created through beautiful cooperation between human and machine. Twenty-five percent (25%) of primary sales went to the collective DAO-owned treasury, controlled by a representative DAO Committee and the DAO Community of NFT holders.

A second and latest access point to the omgkirby DAO is [a generative drop of 5,000 avatars](https://mirror.xyz/omgkirby.eth/Xjbm1pq-9mJF7gx-tvx3zUp\_s4B3LCL89vmuPCYMENY) created by Singaporean digital artist [ValerieHazLife](https://www.instagram.com/valeriehazlife/?hl=en). Free to mint for any omgkirby Genesis NFT holder and inspired by the radical possibilities of anonymity and community, these PFPs offer a way for new members to join the omgkirby DAO community.

**NFT/PFP Utility**

* NFT owners gain complete ownership of the song in its entirety, including Master Recording and Publishing rights. This also includes access to lossless 24-Bit stem masters which will be made available soon.
* All NFT holders are members of the omgkirby DAO and control the omgkirby treasury. Each NFT equates to 1 vote in community decision-making and over how the DAO treasury is used.
* omgkirby is the sole determinant of future NFT drops. A portion of every future NFT primary sale (10%) will go to the DAO’s treasury and DAO members will have first exclusive access.

**DAO Structure**

The omgkirby DAO is made up of multiple modular layers with the artist at the center of a nested configuration (Fig. 1). These layers are distinct yet fluid and have varying degrees of sovereignty. The DAO’s two primary governing bodies are the **DAO Committee** and the **DAO Community**. Operations of the DAO are structured through instance-based **Working Groups**, which form and dissolve according to Working Group Sessions, which last for a period of eight (8) weeks per session. The DAOs organizational structure is depicted in the figure below:\
