# Governance Roadmap





The following is a proposed governance roadmap that outlines a trajectory moving toward increased decentralization and automation of DAO governance. This is an initial outline and subject to change as the DAO evolves and community interests and objectives shift.

The stages outlined below spread over a total time period of 18-24 calendar months whereby the rhythm of activity within the DAO is sequentially arranged in ‘Sessions’. Each Session is two months long with one month in between sessions as outlined below.

| Month 1                   | Month 2 &3 | Month 4                   | Month 5 &6 | Month 7                   | Month 8 &9 | Month 10                  | Month 11 & 12 |   |   |
