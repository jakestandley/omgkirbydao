# Types of Proposals

Governance proposals outside of Working Group Session Proposals (WGSP) will be referred to as omgkirby DAO Governance Improvement Proposals (omg-GIP). In this initial iteration of the Lite Paper, proposals are divided into four different types: Low impact - Reversible; Low impact - Irreversible Proposal; High Impact - Reversible Proposal; High Impact - Irreversible Proposals. Low impact proposals are resolved through informal dialogue and voting in Discord. Working Group formation and high impact proposals are resolved through off-chain snapshot voting. The following section will be used as a starting point for workshopping to be completed by the DAO Operations Working Group during the upcoming Working Group Session 2.

1. **Low Threshold**
   1. **Low impact - Reversible Proposal:** These decisions do not need a time and resource intensive process and must be optimized for speed. Since these decisions are the easiest way to encourage engagement within the broader DAO Community, the decision-making process is kept lean and virtually friction-less. There is no required quorum for proposals in this category, which are considered “Approved” if they are supported by at least 51% of participating voting power. The proposal may then move on for execution. Proposals of this category are relatively informal, and conducted off-chain via discord. _**Discussion Prompt for WGS2:** In the context of omgKirby DAO, what type of decisions would fall under this category?_

1. **Medium to High Threshold**
   1. **Low impact - Irreversible Proposal:** Due to their low-impact nature, decisions under this category do not warrant a lengthy process. However, it is important to optimize them for both cost and quality since they make an irreversible use of the DAO’s resources. These decisions may act as an initial engagement pathway for community members who want to lead initiatives but do not have prior experience of doing so. Low impact initiatives are capped at <3% (placeholder %) of the total DAO treasury and require the members initiating the motion to put forward an omgkirby DAO Governance Governance Improvement Proposal (omg-GIP)

1. **High Impact - Reversible Proposal:** Decisions that fall under this category offer maximum opportunity for exploration, creative experimentation, and research on the DAO’s evolution. Therefore, these must be optimized for both agility and quality. Members introducing initiatives under this category must put forward a Working Group Session Proposal (WGSP) during a Working Group Application period.. If accepted, these proposals are executed through Working Groups comprising DAO contributors who are accountable to the broader DAO community. Lessons learned through these session initiatives are captured and shared to feed into subsequent iterative cycles.

_**Discussion Prompt for WGS2:** In the context of omgKirby DAO, what type of decisions would fall under this category? And what voting thresholds should we have?_

| <p><strong>Stage 1: Temperature Check</strong></p><p>A White version of omg-GIP is sent to the community on Discord to gauge general interest. Community members have 24-36 hours to indicate whether they think this proposal should be formally voted on through emoji reaction on Discord.</p><p>↓</p><p><strong>Stage 2: Open Discussion</strong></p><p>If the White proposal receives enough engagement and if the majority of these voters say the proposal should be voted on, the proposal enters an open discussion phase. During this time the community discusses the contents of the proposal in greater detail, suggests amendments, raises concerns.</p><p>↓</p><p><strong>Stage 3: Revision</strong></p><p>The original poster(s) may then refine the proposal to take into account community’s suggestions and post a detailed omg-GIP on Snapshot for voting</p><p>↓</p><p><strong>Stage 4: Voting</strong></p><p>Voting on Snapshot is open and during this time the community votes For/ Against/ Abstain. 1 NFT/PFP= 1 Vote</p><p>↓</p><p><strong>Stage 5: Results</strong></p><p>The proposal is Approved or Rejected. Results are announced.</p> |

1. **High Impact - Irreversible Proposals:** Decisions that impact the fundamental structure or protocols within the DAO fall under this category. These critical proposals undergo the most rigorous decision-making process which is carefully designed to ensure inclusivity, and due diligence and minimize hijacking. Critical omg-GIPs need to be solutioned by a working group of DAO Contributors and approved by the DAO Committee before they can be voted on by the DAO Community. These proposals need a high threshold of ⅔ majority of participating voting power, along with ⅔ majority DAO Committee ratification to pass.

An overview of the proposal process can be found in the table below, depicting the four levels of proposals. During WGS2, the DAO Operations Working Group will review these types of proposals and formalize the governing process for low threshold, low impact proposals and more importantly, omgkirby DAO Governance Improvement Proposals (omg-GIP).
