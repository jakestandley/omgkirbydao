# üë∑‚ôÄ Working Groups

Over the last 2 weeks, we‚Äôve come together to create and approve our [first Session proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/omgkirby.eth/proposal/0xc5d534bc5a33eb7d8a4aab73c60283212e55af2b9f935775b098bf781880dfca). We saw 212 community members turn out to vote. This is approx: 10% of our Discord community (\~2400). For reference, [Friends With Benefits‚Äô](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth) last 5 proposals saw between 80-260 votes, for a Discord with 11K members.&#x20;

We are pleased with our beginning participation levels from the community, but strive to continue to increase participation.&#x20;

There are three main levels of active participation in the DAO we see at this point:&#x20;

1. Voting in the DAO&#x20;
2. Participating in Session initiatives by joining working groups&#x20;
3. Day-to-day participation in our discord community.&#x20;

As we‚Äôve implemented with our Snapshot voting, we believe POAPs, responsibility-based roles, and participation in DAO initiatives will be the best way to begin to build out a reputation system that will allow active participants in the DAO to credential themselves and position themselves as leaders within the DAO.&#x20;

Our next step towards fostering community leadership in the omgkirbyDAO is to introduce our ‚Äúworking groups‚Äù concept. Working groups are purpose-based, temporal, opt-in committees of community members that set out to achieve milestones for the DAO. These working groups will be given free-reign to deliver value to the DAO, but held accountable to the community through proposals that cover implementation/costs and other logistics that ensure resources are being used effectively.&#x20;

For the first iteration of our working groups, we are going to leverage the [work done by the Coop Index](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/laying-the-rails-for-working-groups-wg-v1/975) in how they‚Äôve structured their working groups. Below we are using the outline made by the Coop Index. Please note, that links are included for context from their original write up. We will make some tweaks for our community‚Äôs needs/context, however we want to make sure that credit is given to the heavy lifting they‚Äôve done in pioneering the structure we‚Äôll build on top of.&#x20;

## Working Group Model

Working Group Model If successful, Working Groups will enable clear leaders to assume responsibility for delivering meaningful outcomes that benefit the entire omgkirbyDAO.&#x20;

Read on for&#x20;

1. Core Principles&#x20;
2. \What are Working Groups?&#x20;
3. How are they created?&#x20;
4. Next Steps&#x20;

### Core Principles&#x20;

6 principles have remained front & center when thinking about doubling down on this model:&#x20;

1. Enable community members to gain more autonomy & accountability.&#x20;
2. Ensure focus on high-impact work that addresses core needs that will benefit the entire Coop community.&#x20;
3. Ensures that those who drive outcomes are remunerated accordingly.&#x20;
4. Enable a clear path to budget.&#x20;
5. Ensure community members are set up for success.&#x20;
6. Remain flexible & iterative&#x20;

### What are working groups?&#x20;

Based largely on learnings generated from the [Growth Working Group 22 ](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/launching-a-growth-working-group/602)& other crypto communities (see ‚ÄúAddendum‚Äù), here are a some clear characteristics:&#x20;

1. _Problem-oriented:_ Working groups are formed to solve specific problems, or take advantage of specific opportunities, in service of the entire omgkirbyDAO community.&#x20;
2. _Concrete Outcomes/Measurable Results:_ Ahead of their creation, it is clear what they intend to accomplish for the DAO. They are responsible for producing outcomes that impact omgkirbyDAO objectives. The process for implementing solutions and measuring impact must be described in the proposals generated by working groups.&#x20;
3. _Big Commitment:_ WG leader(s) are committed to serving the entire omgkirby community with the outcomes they are being paid to produce. This is for the comparatively few folks who have the time, energy, bandwidth, focus, and desire to uphold this level of commitment. WGs should have 1 directly responsible individual, and at most, 1 additional co-lead.&#x20;
4. _Time-bound:_ For starters, they are time-bound to a given session at most. We need to maximize iteration & learning.&#x20;
5. _Funding:_ They are approved & funded directly by the Treasury Committee (TC) after an in-the-open process.&#x20;
6. _Reporting:_ Leaders will be required to set KPIs and update the community each week on their progress. Growing the pool of shared understanding is a fundamental goal.&#x20;
7. _Continuity Commitment:_ WG leaders must commit to ensuring continuity of their work at the end of their specific WG‚Äôs existence.&#x20;
8. _No overlap:_ WG‚Äôs should not be redundant with an already operating WG.&#x20;

### How are they created?&#x20;

To enable omgkirbyDAO community members to quickly launch and learn, this is being kept simple, off-chain, and flexible for starters. Largely, it is making explicit steps the GWG took to create itself.&#x20;

Here are the steps we‚Äôll start with and learn from:&#x20;

1. \[Optional/Recommended] Outline to the forum for community feedback (i.e. [AWG 4](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/request-for-feedback-analytics-working-group/870))&#x20;
2. Initial proposal posted to forum for community feedback ([Google Doc Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vYACvPrzBHo3BlaLO1goyHx2XB\_gDs\_BzE7S0k-Jyq8/edit?usp=sharing)) - more on this below&#x20;
3. Treasury Committee assesses (1:1 feedback + public feedback so others can learn)&#x20;
4. Updates to initial proposal made + temperature check vote to the forum&#x20;
   1. Forum Vote: Are you in favor of launching a \[working\_group\_name] as described? \[Y/N]&#x20;
5. (if approved) Gnosis Multi-Sig Funded&#x20;
6. (if approved) WG Leader(s) compensated monthly via Treasury Committee reward process&#x20;

If running well, the creation process should take less than 5 business days end-to-end.&#x20;

### Why the Treasury Committee (TC)?&#x20;

* It enables the DAO to hold individuals responsible for rapidly improving this process to the benefit of the entire omgkirby community.&#x20;
* Layering in more working groups adds complexity to the DAO. Clearly responsible individuals ensures that complexity gets managed well for the community.&#x20;
* The TC is a short-cut to funding.&#x20;
* The TC is in position to help manage funding, alignment, and objectives.&#x20;

### Initial Proposal&#x20;

The initial proposal should make clear to any reader the answers to 3 basic questions&#x20;

1. Why should this working group exist?&#x20;
2. What will it achieve?&#x20;
3. How will it achieve it?&#x20;

Please use this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vYACvPrzBHo3BlaLO1goyHx2XB\_gDs\_BzE7S0k-Jyq8/edit?usp=sharing) for the Initial Proposal.&#x20;

You are not alone in creating a proposal. TC members, and I‚Äôm sure other community members, will be excited to help.&#x20;

## Next Steps&#x20;

In the spirit of speed as a habit, and due to the general support expressed by community members, let‚Äôs rapidly move forward with this outline for working groups.&#x20;

There will be learnings as we go along, and it‚Äôll be exciting to update the working group model as we learn together.&#x20;
