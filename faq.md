**omgkirby DAO**&#x20;

The omgkirby DAO is a community for lofi fans, artists, and builders to help shape what omgkirby will become as a community-owned artist and brand. 25% of primary sales will be earmarked to seed the DAO treasury (once created) which will be fully governed by the community. In addition to proceeds from primary sale, 67% of royalties earned from secondary sales of the genesis NFTs will also be directed to the DAO treasury. The founding team has several other ideas to fund the treasury, but we know this only scratches the surface and we can’t wait to see community generated proposals.&#x20;

Some founding team ideas include:&#x20;

* streaming royalties of select future omgkirby releases&#x20;
* omgkirby merch&#x20;
* omgkirby concerts and tours&#x20;
* future nft sales&#x20;
* sales of stem packs&#x20;

**The community will ultimately decide how treasury funds are used but here are some possible ideas from the founding team:**&#x20;

* Fund collabs with other producers and artists&#x20;
